How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging Area is a temporary platform which kind of links the working directory and the repository. It helps in selecting a few files(offers selectivity) in adding to a repo.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches help by keeping the master branch unchanged and by providing a neat label for the new testing feature.

How do the diagrams help you visualise the branch structure?
