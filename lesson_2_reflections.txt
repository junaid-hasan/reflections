What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialise a repository git creates a .git file. However no commits are added.
Initialising a repository is the first step before adding anything to it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging Area is a temporary platform which kind of links the working directory and the repository. It helps in selecting a few files(offers selectivity) in adding to a repo.
