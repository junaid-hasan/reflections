When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When we do not have access to the file on the computer(travel etc), but we have to make essentially at web. Maybe we want a community to collaborate with us in making a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatcally stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

We want to pull when we want to save a copy on our local hard drive. As the copy is always on GitHub, a local copy is not needed. Hence pulling is not automatic.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used to modify the code of someone else without affecting his/her code. Fork is a special term used for clones in the github itself.
Clone is just a copy of a code from one place to another.
Branches are two different versions of a same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

When more than one person is developing a project, often we may find diverging changes, in order to store the change made by others without involving our own change is done by this.
This helps in offline editing and merging of the changes so as to include everything.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without Git or GitHub we need to send e-mails and continuously modify the files. This would be hard. Git or GitHub is simple.
